# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the
SelfWorld community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful and welcoming to newcomers
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing when we make mistakes
* Helping others debug their bot setup or understand the codebase
* Sharing knowledge about Discord.js, MySQL, or bot development in general

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information (tokens, database credentials, Discord IDs)
  without explicit permission
* Attempting to abuse the bot's anonymous messaging features for harassment
* Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
* Discord servers where SelfWorld is discussed or tested
* Any other communication channels related to the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in
public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers at:

* **Email**: [YOUR_EMAIL]
* **Discord**: [YOUR_DISCORD]
* **GitHub**: Open a private security advisory on the repository

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project
maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences
for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the
violation. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions
in project spaces and external channels like Discord. Violating these terms may lead
to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication
with the project for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the
people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a
permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, including sustained
inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward any individual.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.
